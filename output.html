D
uring the 2012–2016 drought, California farm-
ers, particularly those in the San Joaquin Val-
ley, were confronted with higher water prices 
and frequently turned to finite groundwater reserves 
to meet crop water demands (Hanak et al. 2017). The 
economic repercussions of prolonged water shortages 
in the region raise concerns about how to meet crop 
water requirements without degrading the environ-
ment. These concerns contribute to farmers’ hesitation 
to adopt winter cover cropping and reduced-distur-
bance tillage (which relies on leaving crop residue on 
the field and can refer to either no tillage or reduced 
tillage). Although cover cropping (CC) and reduced-
disturbance tillage (RD) improve soil quality and 
benefit ecosystems (Mitchell 2019; Yao et al. 2000), the 
hydrological impacts of these combined practices have 
not been well documented. At a time when groundwa-

Abstract 
California farmers who use reduced-disturbance tillage and winter cover 
cropping can boost production and improve soil health. However, some 
farmers are hesitant to try these conservation practices due to uncertainty 
about whether planting winter cover crops will deplete soil moisture in 
already drought-stricken regions. Our study addresses these concerns by 
looking at how long-term reduced-disturbance tillage and winter cover 
cropping, compared to fallowed soils with standard tillage, affected soil 
moisture. Although we found a statistical difference in total soil water 
content, the difference was only about 0.3 inches of water per foot of soil. 
On average, the soil water content of the top 0–96 inches was highest for 
the reduced-disturbance fields with winter cover crops. This was especially 
evident during our driest field season, from November 1, 2017, to March 15, 
2018, when cumulative rainfall was only 1.9 inches. Our findings show that 
winter cover cropping and reduced-disturbance tillage can improve soil 
without depleting soil water levels in row crops.

</div><div class="page">are meticulously tracking water use, including rainfed 
winter cover crops, there’s a knowledge gap regard-
ing the hydrologic impact of conservation agriculture 
practices. Simultaneously, irrigation districts are grap-
pling with the fate of fallowing farmland and leaving 
some acreage unplanted (Hanak et al. 2021). Research 
addressing the combined impacts of winter cover 
cropping and reduced-disturbance tillage on soil mois-
ture will play an important role in farmers’ planting 
decisions. 
Cover cropping has been widely studied for its 
agronomic and ecosystem benefits. These include 
improving soil porosity (Basche and DeLonge 2017), 
increasing water infiltration into the soil profile and 
reducing soil erosion (Dabney et al. 2001; Fageria et al. 
2005), suppressing early-season weeds (Teasdale 1996), 
increasing microbial diversity (Schmidt et al. 2018), 
biomass and activity (Duchene et al. 2017; Fageria et al. 
2005; Fernandez et al. 2016), mitigating net greenhouse 
gas emissions (Abdalla et al. 2019), reducing nitrogen 
leaching (Abdalla et al. 2019), and minimizing water 
quality degradation (Harter et al. 2012). 
RD minimizes physical disturbance of the soil pro-
file following the harvest of one crop and before the 
establishment of a subsequent crop, while leaving crop 
residues on the soil. Keeping the surface covered with 
residues is an important principle of soil health and 
is central to conservation agriculture (Mitchell et al. 
2019). Reducing tillage and maintaining soil cover has 
been shown to increase soil water-holding capacity and 
to prevent top layer compaction and sealing, especially 
in dry climates (Basche and DeLonge 2017). These ben-
efits have been observed under both irrigated (Klocke 
et al. 2009; van Donk et al. 2010) and rainfed or other-
wise water-limited conditions (Unger and Baumhardt 
1999; Unger and Parker 1976). Residues left on the soil 
surface reduce direct soil evaporation through the 
mulching and shading effect, which reduces surface 
soil temperature, ground heat storage, and direct wind 
effects on evaporation (Klocke et al. 2009; Ranaivoson 
et al. 2017).
Current adoption is low
Financial incentives from state and federal programs 
have promoted both cover cropping and reduced-
disturbance tillage as multi-benefit conservation agri-
culture practices. However, their implementation into 
cropping systems can be complex. As a result, adop-
tion rates vary widely across agroecological systems. 
In California, although rates have been increasing, 
reduced-disturbance tillage is only practiced on 7.1% 
of cropland acreage, compared to the U.S. average of 
34.6%, and only 4.8% of California cropland acreage is 
cover cropped, compared to the U.S. average of 10.7% 
(LaRose and Myers 2019). 
Understanding what drives farmers to change 
their agricultural practices depends on local condi-
tions. Some consistent trends driving adoption of 
conservation practices include access to informa-
tion, perceived costs and benefits (Bergtold et al. 
2012; Knowler and Bradshaw 2007), understanding 
that short-term costs can lead to long-term benefits 
(DeVincentis et al. 2020), and social networks influenc-
ing norms of practice. Additionally, risk perceptions 
and acceptance, environmental attitudes, access to 
financial incentives for adaptation (including conserva-
tion programs such as USDA-NRCS EQIP and CDFA 
Healthy Soils Program), and a host of demographic 
variables specific to the operation and the farmer (e.g., 
farm size, crop type, soil type, farm income, years of 
farming experience, level of education, land tenure, 
etc.) (Knowler and Bradshaw 2007; Prokopy et al. 2008) 
play an important role. 
While we can learn about adoption from similar 
research in other locations, these findings cannot pro-
vide a complete picture of farmer decision-making in 
California, where water limitations are unique. Due 
to the dynamic nature of soil and its slowly changing 
characteristics (Six et al. 2004), long-term research 
studies are critical to addressing questions of agricul-
tural resource management, including the use of prac-
tices such as cover cropping and reduced-disturbance 
tillage. Long-term studies on soil water are particularly 
important in light of concerns that cover crops could 
exacerbate the depletion of soil moisture during the 
winter period due to evapotranspiration (Mitchell et al. 
2015; Unger and Vigil 1998). 
This study expands on earlier work that identified 
trade-offs between soil improvement and soil water 
depletion as a result of winter cover cropping (Mitchell 
et al. 2015) and is aligned with recent findings that 
cover crops do not cause significantly different soil 
moisture or evapotranspirative losses compared to con-
trol plots across 10 sites in California’s Central Valley

</div><div class="page">(DeVincentis et al. 2022). Our 2016–2019 study builds 
on 17 years following the inception of the conservation 
agriculture treatments of reduced-disturbance till-
age and winter cover cropping at a field site in the San 
Joaquin Valley. The focus of this research is to address 
a common scientific question from the local agricul-
tural production and regulatory communities: “Do the 
combined soil conservation practices of winter cover 
cropping and reduced-disturbance tillage have an ob-
servable impact on soil moisture in San Joaquin Valley 
agricultural fields?” 
This study addresses information gaps related to 
actual water use in cover cropping and how cover crops 
and reduced-disturbance tillage affect soil moisture. 
The setting is an annual crop sequence that has been 
underway since 1999. Our goal was to quantify and 
document changes in winter soil water storage due to 
cover crops and reduced-disturbance tillage. 
Long-term field site
In 1999, the National Research Initiative (NRI) – Con-
servation Agriculture Systems Project (CASP) was 
created to evaluate reduced-disturbance tillage as a 
possible practice to reduce particulate matter emissions 
from the intensive soil disturbance tillage in a cotton-
tomato rotation system. Located at the University of 
California’s West Side Research and Extension Center 
(WSREC) in Five Points, California, the CASP study is 
the only study site in the state that has incorporated all 
critical soil health principles in its experimental design. 
For the reduced-disturbance tillage plots, the RD sys-
tem fully transitioned to no tillage (NT) in 2012, with 
the only soil disturbance happening during seeding or 
transplanting. The site thus provides a unique resource 
that permits researchers to quantify the long-term 
impacts of consistently implemented alternative man-
agement practices on soil biodiversity and functions 
(Mitchell et al. 2017). 
Since the initiation of the long-term research site, 
the objectives have been broadened to measure changes 
in soil chemical, physical, and biological properties 
under reduced-disturbance tillage and cover cropping 
management in the historically highly productive San 
Joaquin Valley. Previously published information from 
the site has documented improvements in several soil 
health indicators, including soil aggregate stability and 
water infiltration (Mitchell et al. 2017), abundance and 
diversity of soil macrofauna (Kelly et al. 2021), and soil 
porosity and water-holding characteristics (Araya et al. 
2022). 
Throughout the CASP’s duration, the impacts of 
reduced-disturbannce tillage and cover cropping on 
crop yields have varied by crop. Half of the experimen-
tal field was in a tomato-cotton rotation and the other 
half was in a cotton-tomato rotation with both crops 
grown in each year from 1999 to 2014, followed by 
garbanzo (Cicer arietinum), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor 
L.) (2015 to 2018) and tomato and garbanzo in 2019. 
Tomato yields were 9.5% higher in RD versus standard 
tillage (ST) systems but were 5.7% higher in no-cover 
crop (NO) than in CC systems. The cotton yields were 
10.0% higher in ST than RD and 4.8% higher in NO 
than CC systems in the early years of the study, largely 
due to problems encountered in establishing crop 
stands with no tillage. Sorghum yields in 2016 and 2017 
were similar between RD and ST, while cover crops had 
no effect on sorghum yields in either year. Garbanzo 
yields were higher in RD than ST in 2016 and 2017, but 
similar in 2018. Tomato yields in 2018 were lower in the 
RD-CC system, due to problems that year with cover 
crop regrowth. In general, the yield results between 
treatments need to be viewed cautiously, as they reflect 
the inherent learning curve challenges and mistakes of 
experiment station work.
Experimental design
The 8.8-acre research site consists of 32 plots, each 33 
feet wide by 328 feet long, with a 33-foot border plot 
(buffers) between treatments and six 5-foot buffers 
between rows (fig. 1). See the online technical appendix 
for cover crop mixes, planting and termination dates, 
and irrigation quantities with dates. The soil type is a 
Panoche clay loam with a fine-loamy texture, mixed, 
superactive, and thermic Typic Haplocambids. This soil 
is characterized as being well-drained with moderate 
permeability and formed by alluvial fans in flood plains 
(Mitchell 2015). 
Our study consisted of four combinations of till-
age and cover crop systems, arranged as a randomized 
FIG. 1. Entire experimental field layout for season 1 of our study, consisting of four treatments, two cash crops, and several buffer/border rows. From 
2015 to 2017, the cash crops were sorghum and garbanzos (rotated), in 2018 tomatoes and garbanzos, and in 2019 melons and tomatoes. CC = cover 
crop, NO = no cover crop, RD = reduced-disturbance tillage, ST = standard tillage.

</div><div class="page">complete block design in a typical row crop field in the 
San Joaquin Valley. The four combinations were (1) 
reduced-disturbance tillage with winter cover cropping 
(RD CC), (2) standard tillage with winter cover crop-
ping (ST CC), (3) reduced-disturbance tillage without 
winter cover cropping (RD NO), and (4) standard till-
age without winter cover cropping (ST NO) (fig. 1). 
The cash crops were rotated between seasons to main-
tain variability, while the soil management practices 
within each plot remained consistent. Standard tillage 
practices included surface residue shredding, multiple 
diskings to incorporate the residues from 8 inches to 10 
inches, subsoil ripping to about 14 inches, and an addi-
tional disking, followed by bed shaping using a Wilcox 
Performer implement (Wilcox Agriproducts, Walnut 
Grove, Calif.). 
Plot treatments remained consistent through-
out the study, including management practices such 
as fertilizer and pest management interventions. 
Cover crops were planted by early November of each 
year and terminated in mid-March by mowing and 
spraying the standing residue with 2% glyphosate 
(N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine) for the RD treatments. 
Afterwards, the cover crop residues were disked into 
the soil for ST. Spraying the cover crop decreased the 
lag time between the termination of the cover crop and 
planting of the cash crops. Irrigation water was ap-
plied through a subsurface drip system, installed at the 
field site in 2013, with 1.5-inch diameter tape buried 
12 inches in the center of each 60-inch-wide planting 
bed. Each year of the study the same amount of fall 
pre-plant irrigation water was applied to all of the treat-
ment plots equally (3 inches in 2016, 3.5 inches in 2017, 
and 4 inches in 2018; see technical appendix). 
Probe collects moisture data 
Data for the study were collected between November 
and March for the years 2016 to 2019. Soil moisture was 
measured using a field-calibrated Campbell Nuclear 
Model 503 Hydroprobe (Campbell Pacific Nuclear, 
Martinez, Calif.) neutron probe depth gauge (503 DR 
Hydroprobe). Measurements were taken at 10 different 
depths (6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, and 106 inches 
beneath the soil surface), with one access tube per plot. 
Previous research conducted at the same study site had 
shown that one access tube per plot is sufficient to cap-
ture the soil moisture of the entire treatment plot (Is-
lam et al. 2006) given the homogeneity of soil hydraulic 
properties across the experimental plots. 
On average, the neutron probe sampled a 26.4– 
to 26.8-inch radius of soil moisture at each depth. 
Neutron probe readings (counts of slow neutrons due 
to the interaction with soil water molecules) were re-
corded during the winter periods. The neutron probe 
data set included soil moisture data collected approxi-
mately weekly over three winter seasons from four 
treatments, from November 12, 2016 to April 20, 2017; 
November 7, 2017 to March 26, 2018; and October 17, 
2018 to March 12, 2019. 
The percent canopy cover (the proportion of the soil 
surface area covered by cover crop foliage) was deter-
mined during the 2017–2018 cover crop growing season 
using Canopeo (https://canopeoapp.com), an app that 
measures fractional green canopy cover based on im-
ages captured by a smartphone camera (Patrignani and 
Ochsner 2015). Canopeo separates the green plant area 
from soil surface background and provides an esti-
mated percentage of canopy coverage. 
We used these data to assess the variations of water 
content in the soil profile between cash crop seasons, 
from November to March. This is a critical period 
to capture water from rainfall, because California’s 
Mediterranean climate brings rain almost exclusively 
during the winter months. Neutron probe raw counts 
were manually recorded and then digitized, with the 
values checked for consistency by two research team 
members. The data set included 13,760 observations 
collected over 43 days, down 10 individual soil depths, 
and using 32 neutron probe access tubes. In order to 
compare the treatments over the same time period for 
the three winter seasons, the data set was truncated 
from November 1 to March 15 for each season, result-
ing in 10,880 observations after removing data from 
the 6-inch and 106-inch depths due to concerns about 
surface-atmospheric interactions and missing data, 
respectively. 
The cumulative precipitation each season, from 
November 1 to March 15, was 6.3, 1.9, and 7.1 inches, 
respectively, and the average air temperature for 
November through March for each of the three seasons 
was 50.1°F, 50.1°F, and 49.8°F (CIMIS station no. 2,

</div><div class="page">from November 1 to March 15 for each season was 
0.07, 0.08, and 0.07 inches, respectively. The average 
ETo (PM) from January 1st, 2016 through December 31, 
2019 is 0.18 inches (https://cimis.water.ca.gov/). For the 
purposes of this experiment, we treated the plots within 
the NRI field as comparable, because fall irrigation, 
soil type, and weather conditions remained constant 
among treatment plots, with cash crops being rotated 
each year. The plots that received tillage (ST) and win-
ter cover crops (CC) have remained constant since the 
experimental field started in 1999, regardless of which 
rotational row crop was grown during the summer cash 
crop period.
Data analysis was conducted using R statistical 
software (R Core Team 2020, version 4.4.1). The raw 
neutron probe counts were transformed to volumetric 
water content (VWC) using a calibration equation 
that relates count ratios to percent soil moisture using 
linear regression. The raw neutron probe counts were 
transformed into a count ratio to minimize the impacts 
caused by changes in the probe functionality due to ag-
ing and decay. Count ratios were calculated by dividing 
each raw count by the average of the standard counts 
taken each day of neutron probe readings in the field 
(7127). The calibration equation (VWC% = 22.619x − 
1.587, R2 = 0.96; technical appendix fig. A) was created 
by regressing neutron probe counts and gravimetric 
soil data that was simultaneously collected. In-situ field 
calibration of the 503 Hydroprobe was done by taking 
count readings using the standard calibration feature 
of the probe at a given soil depth, collecting three 2.25-
inch diameter cores at the same depth adjacent to the 
access tube, weighing the soil, drying the sample for 24 
hours at 105°C, weighing the sample again to determine 
the gravimetric water content, and then converting 
gravimetric water content to VWC using the soil bulk 
density values determined from samples that were col-
lected in 2013. 
After every soil neutron probe count was converted 
into VWC (%) using the calibration equation, then 
converted to inches of water per foot of soil (e.g.,  30% 
× 12 inches = 3.6 inches of water per foot), these val-
ues were compared individually (ANOVA), and then 
averaged and compared (Tukey test of means). Prior 
to conducting an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, 
the statistical assumptions were tested. A two-factor 
ANOVA test was performed, comparing the tillage and 
cover factors on each date-depth combination from the 
three field seasons. The date-depth analysis is based on 
the method proposed by DeVincentis et al. (2022). Of 
the 1,032 ANOVA tests, 16% (193) observations showed 
significantly different (P &lt; 0.05) soil water content. We 
removed the data sets that were collected on three date-
depth combinations that showed significant interaction 
(tillage: cover) between Feb. 28, 2017 and March 10, 
2017. The remaining analysis was conducted with the 
final data set of 10,784 individual winter soil water con-
tent values from 43 days of observation (over three field 
seasons), four treatments, and eight depths. 
A post-hoc Tukey test was then performed with all 
the data to determine whether there were differences 
between the average soil water content values of the re-
spective treatments. Two main comparisons were con-
ducted: (a) the average value (inches of water per foot 
of soil) for each of the four treatments across the three 
seasons (depth aggregated), and (b) the average value 
at each depth for each of the four treatments (depth 
resolved). Then, in order to estimate the differences in 
soil water storage between various treatments, the aver-
ages from part (b) above were summed across the mea-
sured soil depth along the depth of measurement (0–96 
inches) for each treatment.

Less tillage, more moisture 
We found that the plots with combined reduced-dis-
turbance tillage and winter cover crops had the highest 
average winter soil moisture from 2016 to 2019. After 
conducting a pair-wise test, all treatment averages are 
statistically different from each other (P &lt; 0.05). How-
ever, the differences between the four combinations 
were minimal. Measured in inches of water per foot 
of soil, the differences were less than 0.5 inch (fig. 2), 
which is a small fraction of the average seasonal tomato 
water requirements (about 30 inches) in the southern 
San Joaquin Valley (Turini et al. 2018). For instance, 
when comparing ST NO to RD CC, there is on average 
0.3 in/ft less water in the standard tillage, no cover crop 
treatment than in the treatment with both soil conser-
vation practices. The main takeaway is that the ST NO 
to RD CC comparison of means is the farthest from the 
zero line in figure 2, and hence has the largest differ-
ence in soil water content.
Translating this further, the results show that, on 
average throughout the November 1–March 15 season, 
there is more water in the plots under RD with winter 
cover crops, compared to the plots under ST without

</div><div class="page">winter cover crops. When comparing the effect of till-
age and cover crops on soil water content, CC has less 
of an impact on the soil moisture than the choice of 
tillage system (i.e., ST NO–ST CC and RD NO–RD CC 
have the least difference in mean levels). In short, com-
pared to fallow or clean-cultivated soil, the cover crops 
are not depleting the soil moisture. 
According to the Tukey test of means, there is a sta-
tistically significant difference between the aggregated 
four treatments (fig. 3). For the ST NO treatment, the 
distribution of observations peaks at the low end of the 
soil moisture spectrum, i.e., around 1–2 inches of water 
per foot of soil, indicating that this treatment generally 
had the least soil water (fig. 3). In contrast, both the 
reduced-disturbance treatments (RD CC and RD NO) 
have distributions that are concentrated farther to the 
right compared to standard tillage treatments (ST CC 
and ST NO), around the upper end of the soil moisture 
spectrum (2–3 inches) (fig. 3). This behavior indicates 
a tendency toward higher soil moisture in reduced-
disturbance treatments.
The conservation agriculture practice of reduced-
disturbance tillage coupled with winter cover cropping 
shows a combined positive impact on soil moisture,

most prominently during drought conditions. In relat-
ing our results to precipitation patterns, despite the 
low precipitation (1.9 inches) during the second season 
(November 1, 2017 to March 15, 2018), the RD CC 
treatment plots showed higher soil moisture content 
throughout the winter season compared to the other 
three treatments (fig. 4). For all three seasons, despite 
the water used to grow cover crops during the winter 
season, there was no noticeable difference in winter soil 
water content between the cover cropped plots and the 
fallow or clean-cultivated plots at the end of the cover 
crop season in March (fig. 4). 
The four treatments differed slightly in behavior 
among the three seasons. The most distinctive dif-
ferences in soil water content down the profile can 
be highlighted in the 2017 drought season, when the 
reduced-disturbance plots had a higher sum of aver-
age soil water content compared to the standard tillage 
plots (fig. 5). When examining the differences in soil 
moisture across depths along the soil profile, water 
down the soil profile follows a similar pattern across 
treatments, with a greater amount of soil water in the 
top and around 72 inches depth (fig. 6). Comparing soil 
water at the same depths in the profile among treat-
ments, again we find that reduced-disturbance tillage 
plots had more soil water than standard tillage plots for 
most of the depths, regardless of the presence of cover 
crops (fig. 6). Additionally, the ST NO plots consis-
tently show the lowest soil water (in water/ft soil) down 
the profile across the three seasons (fig. 6). 
Extensive cover crop canopy
The cover crops were typically seeded by November 
15 of each fall and terminated around March 15 of the 
following spring. This time accounts for a period of 
actively growing biomass, or “solar energy-capturing 
green ground cover,” allowing for about 120 additional

days of living roots in the soil during the year relative 
to the NO systems, which were instead fallow during 
that time. The percent canopy cover, measured dur-
ing the 2017–2018 winter, showed that the cover crop 
increased steadily to over 90% canopy cover during the 
87-day period from November 12 through February 7.
Previous studies have shown that, depending on 
rainfall, climate, and the duration of the growing pe-
riod, cover crops use water for growth and may create 
a water deficit for farmers (Mitchell et al. 2015; Unger 
and Vigil 1998). By contrast, our results suggest that, 
despite the water used by the cover crops, numerous 
benefits can be obtained from these conservation agri-
cultural practices without depleting soil moisture from 
the active rootzone, provided the cover crop growth is 
terminated before periods of higher evapotranspira-
tion demand, i.e., beyond March 15. Our results for the 
aggregated 2016–2019 winter seasons indicate that the 
reduced-disturbance tillage and cover crops (RD CC) 
plots had the most total soil water. This was especially 
evident during the drought of November 2017–March 
2018, with the lowest cumulative rainfall of the three 
seasons of our study — only 1.89 inches, compared to 
6.28 and 7.08 inches during the first and third season 
(fig. 4). 
 The tradeoff outlined in Mitchell et al. (2015) be-
tween winter cover crop growth and soil water deple-
tion was based on the same field site as our study, in 
the 2013 and 2014 seasons. That study found that, 
compared to the fallow soils, cover crops depleted 2.1 
inches of water in 2013 and 0.26 inches in 2014. We hy-
pothesize that this tradeoff has now been overcome due 
to the extended period of reduced-disturbance tillage, 
and the accompanying benefits, including high surface 
residue and retainment of soil moisture. Furthermore, 
Mitchell et al. (2015) measured the soil water content 
only from 0–35 inches of the soil profile, and from 
early January to late March. By comparison, this study

the water content at the end of the study period (mid-
March) is critical to analyzing our data.
The power of living cover
Our study illustrates the effects of winter soil cover 
from living biomass (cover crops) and surface residues. 
In the 2017–2018 winter cover crop season, the RD 
plots started the winter cover crop growing season 
with noticeably more water (fig. 3). This is most likely 
due to post-summer 2017 retention of soil water from 
higher water infiltration combined with higher water 
retention. This aspect can be further explained by the 
comparable summer 2017 cash crop yields and the lack 
of precipitation in October 2017 (CIMIS station No. 2; 
https://cimis.water.ca.gov/WSNReportCriteria.aspx).
As the cash crop yields have remained high 
(Mitchell et al. 2022), we hypothesize that the higher 
soil moisture results from the higher profile-level water 
storage and water availability following irrigation of 
these plots (Araya et al. 2022), developed over several 
years of consistent reduced tillage (Burgess et al. 2014; 
Busari et al. 2015). Combined, these practices lead to 
improved soil water infiltration with increased soil wa-
ter holding capacity, due to the avoidance of soil com-
paction from machinery passes, the additional water 
held by surface residue, and the relatively higher levels 
of soil organic matter in the RD CC plots. Cover crops 
have a mulching effect, lowering soil temperatures and 
reducing soil water loss through evaporation. By com-
bining reduced-disturbance tillage with winter cover 
cropping, the increased water held in the soil profile 
in the reduced-disturbance tillage plots can allow for 
growth of cover crops without depleting soil moisture 
for the subsequent cash crop. 
Our results are in line with similar studies measur-
ing the impact of these practices on soil water content. 
Villamil et al. (2006) found that the combined effect 
of no tillage and winter cover crops increased plant-
available water in an Illinois corn and soybean rota-
tion. Blanco-Canqui et al. (2011) found improved soil 
physical properties, including aggregate stability, and 
hence soil water infiltration, after 15 years of cover 
cropping with no-till. Basche and DeLonge (2017) 
found that total soil porosity and soil water held at field 
capacity increased after 10 years of continuous living 
soil cover, suggesting cover crops as a practice that can 
mitigate the effects of rainfall variability due to climate 
change. Rankoth et al. (2021) found that cover crop 
treatments had higher soil water in the top 12 inches of 
the soil profile, compared to plots without cover crops. 
DeVincentis et al. (2022) found that the differences 
in soil water content between the cover cropped and 
fallowed soil were minimal, aligning with our conclu-
sion that conservation practices do not deplete the soil 
water. 
Our study further supports the conclusions of 
Araya et al. (2022), whose research was conducted at 
the same site at WSREC in Five Points, that combining 
reduced-disturbance tillage with winter cover crops 
increases water capture and retention in the soil profile. 
The complexity of the wintertime soil water dynamics 
must include the shading and mulching effects of cover 
crops, which reduce the soil temperature; this reduces 
the heat transfer into the ground, thus decreasing soil 
evaporation losses (Mitchell et al. 2012). 
Future research should include monitoring the 
response-to-rain of these treatments in order to under-
stand the benefits to infiltration and overall increasing 
soil moisture, ensuring that the soil system can “catch 
and store every drop” of rain or irrigation where it falls 
(USDA 1938). The role of living cover crop biomass in 
capturing, condensing, and percolating moisture from 
fog and dew, in addition to monitoring soil moisture 
and actual ET in cover cropped and clean cultivated 
grounds through the end of April, should be included 
in future investigations of the on-farm water-related 
implications of conservation tillage with winter cover 
crops.
Cost savings vs. new costs 
Translating our results for soil water into economic 
terms, we found that the RD CC had on average 0.3 in/
ft more soil water than the ST NO treatments (fig. 3), 
which summed to 2.4 inches of water for the 8-foot (96 
inches) soil profile. For garbanzo production in ETo 
Zone 15, where seasonal net water requirements are 
19.8 inches (Long et al. 2019), and considering an aver-
age root depth of 5 feet, our suggested practices could 
allow about 6.5% in water saving for farmers. This was 
calculated assuming an average irrigation application 
efficiency of 85%, which results in a seasonal gross wa-
ter demand of 19.8/0.85 = 23.3 inches. The water saving 
using RD + CC equals 0.065 × 23.3 inches = 1.5 inches 
(0.12 acre-foot). Considering an average cost of water 
of $400 per acre-foot during normal years, and $2,000 
per acre-foot during dry years, the resulting economic 
savings range from $50/acre (normal year) to $240/acre 
(dry years). 
Reduced water application would also result in 
tangible energy savings. California agriculture relies 
on energy for lifting, filtering, and pressurizing water. 
From this perspective, the additional soil water storage 
capacity of conservation agriculture plots could result 
in measurable benefits to farm budgets and the envi-
ronment (i.e., reductions in water diversions/extrac-
tions, energy usage, and greenhouse gas emissions). 
However, our economic considerations do not in-
clude the cost to farming operations to establish and 
terminate the cover crops, compared to standard tillage 
and clean cultivated ground. New farm management 
practices will require new farm machinery, as well as 
possible changes in labor demands, irrigation practices, 
and land ownership. The timing of winter cover crop

</div><div class="page">termination or cash crop planting needs to be assessed 
to determine technical and economic viability. Our 
long-term perspective may help address farmers' un-
certainty by illustrating the returns from the financial 
investments required.
Different farming systems
In organic farming systems, winter CC and RD may 
pose additional complications. The NRI field site is set 
up as a conventional farming system, using herbicide 
spray to terminate the winter cover cropping before 
planting the cash crops. Terminating the cover crops 
with herbicides greatly shortens the transition time 
between cover crops and cash crops due to the fast de-
composition time of residues from the terminated cover 
crops. For organic farms, mowers, crimpers, or other 
farm machinery can be used to terminate the cover 
crops, and may have weed reduction benefits (Wort-
man et al. 2013), but these represent a significant capital 
expenditure. 
Regarding specialty crops in California, DeVincentis 
et al. (2020) conducted an extensive cost-benefit analy-
sis of winter cover cropping. That study found that the 
long-term benefits depend on several factors, including 
irrigation, water savings due to soil properties, financial 
subsidies, the cropping system, and finally the impacts 
of climate change. Future research should include a 
cost-benefit analysis of the transition from standard till-
age and fallow field treatment to reduced-disturbance 
tillage and winter cover cropping for row crops. The 
implementation of such practices is currently supported 
in California through financial subsidies provided 
by state programs such as the Healthy Soil Initiative 
(CDFA-HSP). 
Our research conclusions may hold in similar 
Mediterranean climate cropping systems, with cash 
crops other than grain sorghum, garbanzo, and to-
matoes. With a focus on drought-tolerant cash crops 
in combination with winter cover cropping, we have 
shown that reduced-disturbance tillage and winter 
cover crops can be implemented together without com-
promising the available soil moisture. 
Capturing every drop
Understanding how winter cover crops affect water 
balance and water management is critical, as climate 
change increases both the frequency and intensity of 
California droughts (Diffenbaugh et al. 2015) and their 
alternation with wet years and flooding. A report by the 
California Department of Water Resources (DWR 2015) 
found that California is expected to be 15% to 35% drier 
by 2100, with snowpack under a high warming scenario 
likely to be reduced by 65%, jeopardizing our surface 
water supply in a state where groundwater is also scarce. 
Even if rain does fall during the winter season, 
the intensity or amount of rain over a given period of 
time is projected to increase (Pathak et al. 2018), which 
emphasizes the need to build soil that can capture every 
drop and hold this moisture in the profile. The com-
bined use of winter cover crops with reduced-distur-
bance tillage can be a strategy for improved economic 
water productivity, with more marketable product per 
unit of consumptive water use within the San Joaquin 
Valley water portfolio options (Hanak et al. 2021), and 
should be politically and financially incentivized for 
farmer adoption.
Twenty years of continuous reduced-disturbance 
tillage coupled with winter cover crops have provided 
evidence that these practices can be implemented in 
unison without depleting soil moisture levels in the 
drought-prone San Joaquin Valley. Going forward, 
these findings will hopefully encourage farmers to 
implement conservation practices that help foster viable 
production and healthy soils despite very challenging 
circumstances.
